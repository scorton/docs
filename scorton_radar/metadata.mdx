# Structure of Results

Each technical analysis generates a set of metadata grouped by category.
These indicators help understand the strengths and weaknesses of a domain or scanned service.

Categories include:
- **Technical Hygiene**
- **Network Exposure**
- **Reputation & Threats**
- **Public Data**
- **Vulnerabilities**
- **URL / Domain**
- **AI / Technical Scores**

| **TLS_expiry_days** | Number of days before SSL certificate expiration |
| **cert_self_signed** | Indicates whether the certificate is self-signed (not issued by a trusted CA) |
| **cert_cn** | Common Name of the certificate, usually matching the domain name |
| **san_count** | Number of *Subject Alternative Names* included in the certificate |
| **CSP_completeness** | Coverage level of the *Content Security Policy* (CSP) |
| **Security_headers_count** | Number of security-related HTTP headers detected |
| **CSRF_protection** | Indicates whether CSRF protection is enabled |
| **Secure_cookie_flag** | Whether cookies are marked as *Secure* |
| **CSP_header**, **HSTS_header**, **X_Frame_Options** | Binary indicators for the presence of key HTTP headers |
